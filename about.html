            <h1>Hey there, I'm Tiziano!<span class="small">
                    (but&nbsp;you&nbsp;can&nbsp;call&nbsp;me&nbsp;Tizi&nbsp;‚òÄÔ∏èüòéüëç)</span></h1><br />
            <p>I'm a passionate student studying IT with a focus on Application Development at Thomas More in Geel. I'm
                on my second year now, and should be finished next year. I have a deep interest in creating innovative
                solutions and leveraging technology to solve real-world problems.<br /><br />
                Throughout my academic journey, I have been immersed in a wide range of courses and projects that have
                allowed me to develop a strong foundation in programming languages such as Python, Java and C#, as well
                as hands-on experience in software development methodologies and best practices. I
                thrive on the challenge of translating ideas into functional and user-friendly applications.
                What excites me most about IT and application development is the power to create impactful solutions
                that make people's lives easier. I believe in the importance of user-centric design and strive to
                develop applications that are not only technically sound but also intuitive and enjoyable to
                use.<br /><br />
