                Here you can find some of the projects I have worked on during my studies. I have worked on
                projects in groups and individually. I have worked on projects in which I had to create all kinds of
                different things, from websites to automatic fish feeders (yes, really üê†).

                    <p>
                        For the course Requirements Analysis, I had to get together with a team to figure out what our
                        customer wanted in his web application. The app was for a hockeyclub who wanted to move their
                        administrative tasks from paper to a better platform.

                    <h1>PHP Website</h1>
                    <p>During my second year, we needed to make a webapp using PHP Laravel. The project is still
                        ongoing, but is to be finished soon.<br />
                        This project is made with a team of 6 people. We are making a website for a fictional
                        bikingclub. In the group, I have the role of Scrum Master. I make sure that the team is working
                        on the right things and that we are working efficiently. Of course, I also help with the pages
                        and code of the website.

                        For the course DevOps &amp; Security, I created a small math game you can play. The game is made
                        with
                        Windows Forms C#. The game is extremely simple and you can play it yourself by downloading the
                        game
                        from my

                    <h1>Automatic fish feeder</h1>
                    <p>For the course IoT Essentials, I had to create an automatic fish feeder.
                        The fish feeder was relatively advanced, as it had to be able to feed the fish at a certain
                        time, as well as track some statistics like the water level. It had to be able to display these
                        stats on an LCD connected to the Raspberry Pi. I had a ton of fun building this project and
                        coding it to be able to do all these things. I also learned a lot about the Raspberry Pi and
                        connecting devices to it.
