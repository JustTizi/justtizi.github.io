                Here you can find some of the projects I have worked on during my studies. I have worked on
                projects in groups and individually. I have worked on projects in which I had to create all kinds of
                different things, from websites to automatic fish feeders (yes, really üê†).

                <p>
                    For the course Requirements Analysis, I had to get together with a team to figure out what our
                    customer wanted in his web application. The app was for a hockeyclub who wanted to move their
                    administrative tasks from paper to a better platform.

                    For the course DevOps &amp; Security, I created a small math game you can play. The game is made
                    with
                    Windows Forms C#. The game is extremely simple and you can play it yourself by downloading the game
